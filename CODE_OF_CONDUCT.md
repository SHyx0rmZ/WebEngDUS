# Code Of Conduct

## 1. Need Help?

Please tweet/DM us at [@WebEngDus](https://twitter.com/WebEngDus), send us a message via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/)  or talk to us directly during the [events](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/).

## 2. Principles

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, friendly and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of orga team immediately (see section "1. Need Help?"). They may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the events / the community. We value your attendance.

We expect every member, guest, speaker and sponsor to follow these rules at all events and in our online community.

## 4. Recruiting and Advertising

In addition to the principles outlined above, participants are also asked to refrain from any advertising and recruiting activity during the events or online.
We understand that demand for developers greatly outstrips supply, allowing recruiting through our events or in online communication would reduce the quality of the community and its discussions.
Speakers at our events are welcome to mention their upcoming product launch, their startup idea or that their company is hiring, as long as it is kept short and the focus remains on the content of their talk.
